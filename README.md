This is the beginning of something new.

I strongly believe value should not be expressed in material product. Helping people should not be about giving material things, but more about the Heart and Mind. Anyone with a great heart and mind will be capable of solving their own problems and grow in life.

This is my life goal:

To help (a larger amount of people), not in material stuff, but in the Heart and Mind.

It's both as simple and abstract as that. This is both my goal and my mantra and has been ever since I was a little kid.
